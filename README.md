# take-home-tests

When it comes to measuring programming competency, I like take-home tests.  Accomplishing a task in a comfortable work environment just seems like a better simulacrum of day-to-day programming work than whiteboarding while strangers judge your every breath.

But beyond that, I tend to find that when I complete a take-home test, I learn things.  I'll find a hole in my understanding of a concept, or I'm presented with a problem or a paradigm I've never tackled before.  And just like I would on the job, I have the chance to do research to overcome these obstacles and grow my abilities.

This repository contains some small projects which were created as part of take-home tests.  I've only included projects that were non-trivial in nature, so nothing as small as the algorithm to reverse an array.
